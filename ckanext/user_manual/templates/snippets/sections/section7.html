    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Simple Search</li>
    <li>advanced search</li>
</ul>

<h4> {%trans%} Simple Search Rules {%endtrans%}:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>The search words are optional by default</b> <br> Ex: Oxygen → all datasets that have the word "oxygen"  {%endtrans%}
    </li>

     <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Mandatory word → +</b> <br>   
            Ex: oxygen +free → datasets that contain "oxygen" and must have the word "free"  
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Prohibited word → -</b> <br>   
            Ex: oxygen -free → datasets that contain "oxygen" and excluded the ones with the word "free"
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>

    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Phrase → " "</b> <br>   
            Ex: "oxygen free" → datasets that contain "oxygen free" as a phrase
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>

    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Stemming. Ckan search engine (solr) uses stemming on a search query </b> <br>   
            Ex: search for "produce" also searches for "producing" and "production"
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>

    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Does NOT support wild card search</b> <br>   
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>

</ul>

        {%trans%} <b>The advanced search get enabled if the user utilize colon in the search query</b> <br>   
            title:chemistry → all datasets that have the word "chemistry" in their title 
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>
    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Wild card search → *</b> <br>   
            title:chem* → all datasets that have the words which start with "chem" such as "Chemistry" or "Chemical"
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>

    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>OR → ||</b> <br>   
            title:chemistry || title:bio → all datasets that have the word "chemistry"  OR "bio" in their title
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>

    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Proximity → ~</b> <br>   
            title:"chemistry bio" ~ 4 → all datasets that have the word "chemistry"  and "bio" in their title with 4 words in between (chemistry XX AA BB KK bio)
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>

    <li>
        {%trans%} <b>Fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein Distance:</b> <br>   
            author: powell~ → searches for words in close distance to the search term such as “jowell” or “pomell”
        {%endtrans%}
    </li>
