<p>You can access CKAN’s “Create dataset” page in two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Select the “Datasets” link at the top of any page. From this, above the search box, select the “Add Dataset” button.
        </p>        
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Alternatively, select the “organizations” link at the top of a page. Now select the page for the organization that should 
            own your new dataset. Provided that you are a member of this organization, you can now select the “Add Dataset” 
            button above the search box.
        </p>        
    </li>
</ul> 
<br>
<p>CKAN will ask for the following information (metadata) about your data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Title</strong>  – this title will be unique across CKAN, so make it brief but specific. E.g. 
            “UK population density by region” is better than “Population figures”.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Description</strong>  – You can add a longer description of the dataset here, including information such as where the data 
            is from and any information that people will need to know when using the data.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Tags</strong>  – here you may add tags that will help people find the data and link it with other 
            related data. Examples could be “population”, “crime”, “East Anglia”. Hit the <return> key between tags. 
            If you enter a tag wrongly, you can use its delete button to remove it before saving the dataset.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>License</strong>  – it is important to include license information so that people know how they can use 
            the data. If you need to use a license not on the list, 
            contact your site administrator.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Organization</strong> – If you are a member of any organizations, this drop-down will enable you to
             choose which one should own the dataset. Ensure the default chosen is the correct one before you proceed.              
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Visibility</strong> – <i>Public</i> (anybody can see the dataset) OR <br> <i>Private</i> (only the organization members)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Source</strong> the dataset source if exists (Ex: http://www.example.com/dataset.json)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Version</strong> the dataset version
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Author Name and Email</strong>
        </p>
    </li>

            <strong>Maintainer Name and Email</strong>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Custom field(s)</strong> – Additional information about the dataset if exist
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

        it is a good practice to provide description, license, and organization.
